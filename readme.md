# Free OneNote! 

To free your OneNote notes using the Graph API, either download the
script from here or the PowerShell Gallery:

`Install-Script -Name Export-OneNote`

and then run it (on any operating system):

```powershell
./Export-OneNote.ps1 -Notebook 'My Notebook' -Path "$home/freedomfromproprietaryformats"
```

To use your own App Registration, please look at my accompanying blog post. I'd rather
not describe it twice.
